API SEARCH ENGINE

This is a web development project that uses React and Sass to create a book search application. The application allows users to search for books by a search term and retrieves book data using the Google Books API.

Features
Book search: Users can enter a search term in the search input field to search for books. The application retrieves book data from the Google Books API based on the search term entered by the user.
Book display: The retrieved book data is displayed in a visually appealing manner, with book covers, titles, authors, and button to show more information shown in a responsive and user-friendly interface.
Book details: Users can click on a button "More info" to view more details, such as a book description, number of pages and volume number.
Responsive design: The application is designed to be responsive and optimized for various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, to ensure a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.
Sass integration: Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is used as a CSS preprocessor, allowing for efficient and modular styling of the application with features such as variables, mixins, and nested styles.
Technologies Used
React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a fast and efficient way to create interactive UI components and manage the state of the application.
